class: it is a blueprint/template to create/instanciate an objects.

object: java object is a real time entity, which will get the memory allocation
        in RAM(HEAP) memory. when it is created based on class name.
        
class properties:
- fields/variables: state/identity of the object.

	=> these fields again divided into two types
	
	1. non-static fields/variables: means they are not declared with 'static' keyword. 
	2. static fields/variables: means declared with 'static' keyword.
	
- behavior/methods: to write a logic/print object details. 
 	=> these methods again divided into two types
 	
 	1. non-static methods: means they are not declared with 'static' keyword. 
	2. static methods: means they are declared with 'static' keyword.

- constructor: 
	- it is a special method, use to initialize an object.
	- class name and constructor must be same.
	- constructor do not have return type,	
	- Note: but constructor will return current class object.
	
	=> these constructors are again of two types,
	1. default/zero/no-parameterized constructor
	2. parameterized constructor
